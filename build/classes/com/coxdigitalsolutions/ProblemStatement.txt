URL segmentation Problem:
 
1.       You are given a list of URLs. Write a C# or Java program to find keywords from these URLs. These keywords are to be used for categorizing these URLs into 1 of 50 categories such as Sports, Education, Entertainment, etc. However, for this exercise you do not have to categorize the URLs, merely generate the “keywords” that are present in the URL. We have attached the list of American English dictionary for your use. 
 
a.       For example, http://www.wfmz.com/lifestyle/travel/Investigators-get-voice-recorder-from-JetBlue-flight/-/133130/9758668/-/e0so4d/-/index.html
Keywords: Lifestyle, travel investigators,get,voice,recorder,from,jetblue,flight
 
b.      Another example: http://stumbleupon.com
Keywords: Stumble, upon
 
c.       Yet another example: http://fantastic.com
Keywords: Fantastic
Note: Do not generate: fan as it is not the longest word
 
Output can be in any format – csv, excel, etc.
 
2.       Bonus points if you can refine the input or suggest (in writing) what you might explore to help with the next stage of the problem, i.e., the categorization of the urls
